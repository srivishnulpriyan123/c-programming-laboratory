Level 1:

1. Write a program given two numbers, the task is to use alternative bits

within two numbers to create result. We take first bits of second number,then second bit of the first number, third bit of second number and take the

fourth bit of a first number and so on and generate a number with it.

Examples :

Input : n = 10, m = 11

Output : 11

Start from right of second number

Binary representation of n = 1 0 1 0

^ ^

Binary representation of m = 1 0 1 1

^ ^

Output is = 1 0 1 1

Input : n = 20, m = 7

Output : 5

Start from right of second number

binary representation of n = 1 0 1 0 0

^ ^

binary representation of m = 0 0 1 1 1

^ ^ ^

Output is = 0 0 1 0 1

2. Write a Program to Count the Number of Trailing Zeroes in the binary

representation of a given positive Integer n.

Question Description : Given an integer, for n = 12, its binary representation is 1100

(used bits) and number of trailing zero bits is 2. Another Example is n = 8 and the output

= 3, binary of 8 is 1000 (Used bits), so there are three trailing zero bits.

Constraints: 1 <= n <= 103

Instruction: To run your custom test cases strictly map your input and output layout with

the visible test cases.

3. Write a program We have given a large number now we can easily find out

the factorial of this large number. programmers who need more precision

than 64 bits.

Level 2:

1. Write a program given a non-negative integer n, the problem is to reverse the bits

of n and print the number obtained after reversing the bits.

Note that the actual binary representation of the number is being considered for

reversing the bits, no leading 0’s are being considered.

Constraint: The entered number n is a positive integer.

Examples:

Input:

11

Output:

13

Explanation :

(11)10 = (1011)2.

After reversing the bits we get: (1101)2 = (13)10.

Input:

10

Output :

5

Explanation :

(10)10 = (1010)2.

After reversing the bits we get: (0101)2 = (101)2 = (5)10.

2. Write a program given a number n, the task is to Toggle all even position bits of

a number.

Constraint: The entered number n is a positive integer.

Examples:

Input:

10

Output:

0

Explanation :

binary representation of 10 is = 1 0 1 0

After toggling even bits = 0 0 0 0

So the equivalent decimal value is = 0

Input:

20

Output :

30
Explanation :

binary representation of 20 = 1 0 1 0 0

After toggle = 1 1 1 1 0

So the equivalent decimal value is = 30

3. Write a program to add two numbers.While adding two binary numbers by hand

we keep the carry bits in mind and add it at the same time. But to do same thing

in program we need a lot of checks. Recursive solution can be imagined as

addition of carry and a^b (two inputs) until carry becomes 0.

Sample Input and Output-1:

Enter any two numbers : 45 45

90

Sample Input and Output-2:

Enter any two numbers : 4 78

82
